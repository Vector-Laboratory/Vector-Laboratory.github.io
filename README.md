# Vector Labs github.io Page

This is the landing site for Vector Labs and the Arra programming language.

For the time being, this will host various documentation about the language while it is being developed. A release is upcoming!

- [Overview](./doc/OVERVIEW.md) — design motivation, the eleven hook keywords, and the generalization arc from APL
- [Syntax](./doc/SYNTAX.md) — full surface grammar reference
- [Semantics](./doc/SEMANTICS.md) — type system, hook dispatch, effects, and operational semantics
- [Core IR](./doc/CORE.md) — Core intermediate language: invariants, term/type grammar, effect nodes, primitives
- [Loop IR](./doc/LOOP-IR.md) — structured loop representation between fusion passes and C emission
- [Frontend](./doc/FRONTEND.md) — frontend design: lexer/parser, type checker, Z3 integration, Program T expansion, core lowering
- [Backend](./doc/BACKEND.md) — backend design: treewalk, whole-program passes, effect lowering, fusion, kernels, QCheck
- [Roadmap](./doc/ROADMAP.md) — compiler architecture and implementation phases
